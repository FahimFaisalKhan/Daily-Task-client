# Task Desk

## This is a task management web base application that users can use after they are logged in. Users can add, update or delete tasks. They can also mark a task as completed or not completed. Users can set and update deadlines of the task and add and edit comments with every task. Functionalities of adding task images or updating task images have been included in this project. Data is saved on the MongoDB database and the server is built with the Express.js framework. Tasks are shown in a manner that the newest added tasks appear on top. On mode change, the current display mode (light/dark) is saved in localStorage so that next time the user logs in or refreshes the page, he/she gets his/her preferred mode without toggling the mode button again and again.
